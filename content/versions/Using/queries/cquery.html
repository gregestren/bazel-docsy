<p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  <code>cquery</code> is a variant
  of <a href="query.html"><code>query</code></a> that correctly handles
  <a href="configurable-attributes.md"><code>select()</code></a> and build
  options' effects on the build graph.
</p>

<p>
  It achieves this by running over the results of Bazel's
  <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/concepts.html#evaluation-model">analysis
    phase</a>, which integrates these effects. <code>query</code>, by constrast,
  runs over the results of Bazel's loading phase, before options are evaluated.
</p>

<p>
  For example:
=======
  <code>cquery</code> is a command complementary to <code>query</code> that properly handles
  <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/rules.html#configurations">configurations</a>.
  While <code>cquery</code> returns answers that are more correct, it does not
  replace <code>query</code> as it does not support all of <code>query</code>'s
  functions.</p>
<p>
  <code>cquery</code> achieves configuration awareness by running after the
  <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/concepts.html#evaluation-model">analysis phase</a>
  of a build, unlike traditional <code>query</code>, which runs after the loading phase.</p>
<p>
  The most common use for <code>cquery</code> is obtaining answers that
  correctly evaluate <a href="configurable-attributes.md"><code>select()</code></a>
  statements in configurable attributes. For example:

  Each result includes information about the configuration in which the target

  <code>(HOST)</code>. Non-generated source files, like those commonly
  found in <code>srcs</code>, have no need for configuration and are

  In parentheses after each configured target, there is information about the
  configuration in which that target was built. For most targets, this is an
  (opaque) hash of the build options and values in that configuration. Targets
  configured in the host configuration are marked with HOST. Input files, like
  those found in the <code>srcs</code> attribute of many library rules, have no
  need for configuration and are marked with null.
</p>

<p>
  Keep in mind that <code>cquery</code> works only on the configured target graph. Because of this,
  it does not have insight into artifacts like build actions nor access to

  <code><a href="be/general.html#test_suite">test_suite</a></code>
  rules as they are not configured targets. For the former,
  see <code><a href="aquery.html">aquery</a></code>.
</p>

<h2 id='basic-syntax'>Basic Syntax</h2>

<p>A simple <code>cquery</code> call looks like:</p>

<p><code>bazel cquery "function(//target)"</code></p>

<p>The query expression <code>"function(//target)"</code> consists of the following:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b><code>function(...)</code></b> is the function to run on the target. <code>cquery</code>
    supports most
    of <code>query</code>'s <a href="query.html#functions">functions</a>, plus a
    few new ones.
  </li>
  <li><b><code>//target</code></b> is the expression fed to the function. In this example, the
    expression is a simple target. But the query language also allows nesting of functions.
    See the <a href="query-how-to.html">Query How-To</a> for examples.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>

  phases. Unless otherwise specified, <code>cquery</code> parses the target(s)
  listed in the query
  expression. See <a href="#universe_scope-comma-separated-list"><code>--universe_scope</code></a>
  for querying dependencies of top-level build targets.
</p>

<h2 id='target-pattern-evaluation'>Target Pattern Evaluation</h2>

<p>
  <code>//foo</code> has a different meaning for <code>cquery</code> than
  for <code>query</code>. This is because <code>cquery</code>
  evaluates <i>configured</i> targets and the build graph may have multiple
  configured versions of <code>//foo</code>.
</p>

<p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  For <code>cquery</code>, a target pattern in the query expression evaluates
  to every configured target with a label that matches that pattern. Output is
  deterministic, but <code>cquery</code> makes no ordering guarantee beyond the
  <a href="query.html#graph-order">core query ordering contract</a>.
=======
  <b>The following functions are also in <code>query</code>, but
  have <code>cquery</code>-specific notes:</b>
>>>>>>> Refresh cquery docs in prep for upcoming --universe_scope changes.
</p>

<p>
  This produces subtler results for query expressions than with <code>query</code>.
  For example, the following can produce multiple results:

  <pre>
# Analyzes //foo in the target configuration, but also analyzes
# //genrule_with_foo_as_tool which depends on a host-configured
# //foo. So there are two configured target instances of //foo in
# the build graph.
$ bazel cquery //foo --universe_scope=//foo,//genrule_with_foo_as_tool
//foo (9f87702f17541d32a56488e3b8be8a98e52b06945f7)
//foo (HOST)
  </pre>

</p>

<p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  If you want to precisely declare which instance to query over, use
  the <a href="#config"><code>config</code></a> function.
=======
<code>cquery</code>'s <code>somepath</code> operator functions almost exactly like <code>query</code>'s: it computes paths between two sets of targets. But since <code>cquery</code> runs on configured targets, <code>cquery(//foo, //bar)</code> parses as "find a path from <code>//foo</code> <i>in the target configuration</i> to <code>//bar</code> <i>in the target configuration</i>".

  <code>cquery</code> also introduces the following new functions:
=======
  <b>The following functions are unique to <code>cquery</code>:</b>
>>>>>>> Refresh cquery docs in prep for upcoming --universe_scope changes.
</p>

<h3 id="config">config</h3>

<p><code>expr ::= config(expr, word)</code></p>

<p>
  The <code>config</code> operator attempts to find the configured target for
  the label denoted by the first argument and configuration specified by the
  second argument.
</p>

<p>
  Valid values for the second argument
  are <code>"target"</code>, <code>"host"</code>, <code>"null"</code>, or a
  custom configuration hash. Hashes can be retrieved from <code>$
  bazel config</code> or a prevous <code>cquery</code>'s output.
</p>

<p>
  Examples:
</p>

<pre>
$ bazel cquery "config(//bar, host)" --universe_scope=//foo
</pre>

<pre>
$ bazel cquery "deps(//foo)"
//bar (HOST)
//baz (3732cc8c6d40d97)

$ bazel cquery "config(//baz, 3732cc8c6d40d97)"
</pre>

<p>
  If not all results of the first argument can be found in the specified
  configuration, only those that can be found are returned. If no results
  can be found in the specified configuration, the query fails.
</p>

<h3>Build Options</h3>

<p>
  Often, the dependencies of configured targets go through
  <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/rules.html#configurations">transitions</a>,
  which causes their configuration to differ from their dependent. This flag allows you to query
  a target as if it were built as a dependency or a transitive dependency of another target. For
  example:
</p>

<pre>
# x/BUILD
genrule(
     name = "my_gen",
     srcs = ["x.in"],
     outs = ["x.cc"],
     cmd = "$(locations :tool) $&lt; >$@",
     tools = [":tool"],
)
cc_library(
    name = "tool",
)
</pre>

<p>
  Genrules configure their tools in the
  <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/rules.html#configurations">host configuration</a>
  so the following queries would produce the following outputs:
</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-bordered table-params">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Query</th>
      <th>Target Built</th>
      <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>bazel cquery "//x:tool"</td>
      <td>//x:tool</td>
      <td>//x:tool(targetconfig)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>bazel cquery "//x:tool" --universe_scope="//x:my_gen"</td>
      <td>//x:my_gen</td>
      <td>//x:tool(hostconfig)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  If this flag is set, its contents are built. <em>If it's not set, all targets
  mentioned in the query expression are built</em> instead. The transitive closure of the
  built targets are used as the universe of the query. Either way, the targets to
  be built must be buildable at the top level (that is, compatible with top-level
  options). <code>cquery</code> returns results in the transitive closure of these
  top-level targets.
</p>

<p>
  Even if it's possible to build all targets in a query expression at the top
  level, it may be beneficial to not do so. For example, explicitly setting
  <code>--universe_scope</code> could prevent building targets multiple times in
  configurations you don't care about. It could also help specify which configuration version of a
  target you're looking for (since it's not currently possible
  to fully specify this any other way). We recommend that you set this
  flag if your query expression is more complex than <code>deps(//foo)</code>.
</p>

<h4><code>--implicit_deps</code> (boolean, default=True)</h4>

<p>
  Setting this flag to false filters out all results that aren't explicitly set in
  the BUILD file and instead set elsewhere by Bazel.
</p>

<h4><code>--tool_deps</code> (boolean, default=True)</h4>

<p>
  Setting this flag to false filters out all configured targets for which the
  path from the queried target to them crosses a transition between the target
  configuration and the
  <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/rules.html#configurations">non-target configurations</a>.
  If the queried target is in the target configuration, setting <code>--notool_deps</code> will
  only return targets that also are in the target configuration. If the queried
  target is in a non-target configuration, setting <code>--notool_deps</code> will only return
  targets also in non-target configurations.
</p>

<h2 id='output-formats'>Output Formats</h2>

<p> By default, cquery outputs results in a dependency-ordered list of label and configuration pairs.
There are other options for exposing the results as well. </p>

<h3> Transitions </h3>

<pre>
--transitions=lite
--transitions=full
</pre>

<p>
  Configuration <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/rules.html#configurations">transitions</a>
  are used to build targets underneath the top level targets in different configurations than the top
  level targets.
</p>

<p>
  For example, a target might impose a transition to the host transition on all
  dependencies in its <code>tools</code> attribute. These are known as attribute
  transitions. Rules can also impose transitions on their own configurations,
  known as rule class transitions. This output format outputs information about
  these transitions such as what type they are and the effect they have on build
  options.
</p>

<p>This output format is triggered by the <code>--transitions</code> flag which by default is set to
  <code>NONE</code>. It can be set to <code>FULL</code> or <code>LITE</code> mode. <code>FULL</code>
  mode outputs information about rule class transitions and attribute transitions including a detailed
  diff of the options before and after the transition. <code>LITE</code> mode outputs the same information
  without the options diff.
</p>

<h3>Proto</h3>

<pre>
--output=proto
</pre>

<p>
  This option causes the resulting targets to be printed in a binary protocol
  buffer form. The definition of the protocol buffer can be found at

  <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/protobuf/analysis.proto">src/main/protobuf/analysis.proto</a>.
<h4>--[no]proto:include_configurations</h4>

<p>
  By default, cquery results return configuration information as part of each
  configured target. If you'd like to omit this information and get proto output
  that is formatted exactly like query's proto output, set this flag to false

 .


<p>
  See <a href="query.html#output-proto">query's proto output documentation</a>
  for more proto output-related options.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Note</b>: while selects are resolved both at the top level of returned
  targets and within attributes, all possible inputs for selects are still
  included as <code>rule_input</code> fields.

<h2 id='compare'>cquery vs. query</h2>

<p>
  <code>cquery</code> and <code>query</code> complement each other and excel in
  different niches. Consider the following to decide which is right for you:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>cquery</code> follows specific <code>select()</code> branches to
      model the exact graph you build. <code>query</code> doesn't know which
      branch the build chooses, so overapproximates by including all branches.
    </li>
   <li>
      <code>cquery</code>'s precision requires building more of the graph than
      <code>query</code> does. Specifically, <code>cquery</code>
      evaluates <i>configured targets</i> while <code>query</code> only
      evaluates <i>targets</i>. This takes more time and uses more memory.
   </li>
   <li>
      <code>cquery</code>'s intepretation of
      the <a href="query.html#concepts">query language</a> introduces ambiguity
      that <code>query</code> avoids. For example,
      if <code>"//foo"</code> exists in two configurations, which one
      should <code>cquery "deps(//foo)"</code> use?
      The <code><a href="#config">config</a></code></code> function can help with
      this.
   </li>
   <li>
      As a newer tool, <code>cquery</code> lacks support for certain use
      cases. See <a href="#known-issues">Known Issues</a> for details.
   </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
    <strong>All targets that <code>cquery</code> "builds" must have the same
    configuration.</strong>

    <p>
      Before evaluating queries, <code>cquery</code> triggers a build up to just
      before the point where build actions would execute. The targets it
      "builds" are by default selected from all labels that appear in the query
      expression (this can be overridden
      with <a href="#universe_scope-comma-separated-list"><code>--universe_scope</code></a>). These
      must have the same configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
      While these generally share the top-level "target" configuration,
      rules can change their own configuration with

      <a href="skylark/config.html#incoming-edge-transitions">incoming edge transitions</a>.
      This is where </code>cquery</code> falls short.
    </p>

    <p>
      Workaround: If possible, set <code>--universe_scope</code> to a stricter
      scope. For example:
    </p>

    <pre>
# This command attempts to build the transitive closures of both //foo and
# //bar. //bar uses an incoming edge transition to change its --cpu flag.
$ bazel cquery 'somepath(//foo, //bar)'
ERROR: Error doing post analysis query: Top-level targets //foo and //bar
have different configurations (top-level targets with different
configurations is not supported)

# This command only builds the transitive closure of //foo, under which
# //bar should exist in the correct configuration.

    <p>
      <code>cquery</code> does not automatically wipe the build graph from
      previous commands and is therefore prone to picking up results from past
      queries. For example, <code>genquery</code> exerts a host transition on
      its <code>tools</code> attribute - that is, it configures its tools in the
      <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/rules.html#configurations">host
      configuration</a>.

    <p>
      We can see the lingering effects of that transition below.

=======
    <strong>Inaccessible configurations.</strong> With the exception of the host configuration being
    printed as <code>HOST</code>, Configurations are currently output as
    hashes and there is no way for the user to input them (and thus to directly

    must build at the top level in the same configuration.

    <p>
      Workaround: If possible, set <code>--universe_scope</code> to a stricter
