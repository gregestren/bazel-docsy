title: Using Bazel

We should have a soft, high-level introduction to using Bazel here. 

Possibly a combination of basic overview and simple tutorial with examples.

The most obvious thematic fit for this page is the [user's guide](guide). But
that's a good example of the "dive into the deep end" documentation users don't
want to feel immediately forced into.

That calls for a new page here.
